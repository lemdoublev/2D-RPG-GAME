# Adrift

  A 2D Top-Down Action Role-Playing Game based vaguely on Norse Mythology. Takes inspiration from the Dark Souls series in terms of combat and mechanics. The player consumes Stamina, a valuable player resource on attacking or dodging, encouraging thought provoking and engaging combat systems. 
  
  The player earns experience by defeating difficult bosses and enemies throughout procedurally generated dungeons. Experience can only be consumed through completing each dungeon and returning to a main hub and "resting", similar to the Souls series. The player may choose to permanently upgrade their resources (Stamina, Health) with experience, or gain powerful, temporary buffs that aid the player until their next death. 
  
The player can also accrue unique weapons through defeating powerful enemies and bosses which aid their further adventure through each dungeon.
