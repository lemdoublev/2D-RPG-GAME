# Adrift

Adrift is a 2D, action role-playing game featuring procedural level generation, character progression, challenging, unrelenting bosses and loot. Traverse unique dungeons in search for items and experience to level up. Alter your play-style via perks on weapons that bosses can drop.

Adrift was coded in C# and designed by me in Unity Game Engine. It incorporates many popular systems used in game development such as Components for reusabiity and scalability. BinaryFormatter was used to save and load data for the game. Procedural level generation is used to make every level the player experiences a slightly different experience. It is a slight alteration on the Random Walk algorithm to determine where to place rooms in a grid then placing certain premade prefab rooms at those locations. Many other systems such as the perk system are also implemented with the goal of being scalable - simply adding a new Perk script with the functionality of a perk is all that's necessary.
